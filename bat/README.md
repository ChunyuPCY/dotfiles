# Manual Cache Theme

In this repo, `Catppuucin Mocha` is the main color theme.

If the `bat` command is used, the result is not as expected, please excute the following command.

```shell
# Update the binary cache
bat cache --build
```

Finally, use `bat --list-themes` to check if the new themes are available.

> The `BAT_THEME` environment variable is set in the `.zshenv` file.
