> Personal dotfiles configuration

This repo is designed to be checked out to `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. See [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) for more.

I try to follow XDG conventions, but this is a mac-centric config.

## General Personal Setting

- System: `macOS(Apple M2 Max)`
- Font: [`FiraCode Nerd Font`](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)
